# Roll Initiative

A simple golang CLI application that provides a beastiary, spell reference and combat tracking for TTRPGs (Currently just DnD).

## Usage
Most options are controlled with the arrow keys and enter.

While on the main screen, hit `space` to bring up the shortcuts menu and start selecting options.
Note that some options are only available while a certain entry in the table is selected.

## Adding Creatures and Spells
Currently, the program contains all spells and creatures from the 2014 DnD 5e SRD, and an example party.
Creating new spells and creatures can be done by going into the `./srd_data` folder and adding or editing one of the yaml files in there. I will update this README with a format for this in the future.
