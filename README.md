# Roll Initiative

A simple golang CLI application that provides a beastiary, spell reference and combat tracking for TTRPGs (Currently just DnD).

## Adding Creatures and Spells
Currently, the program contains all spells and creatures from the 2014 DnD 5e SRD, along with a few of my own homebrew creations.
Creating new spells and creatures can be done by going into the `./data` folder and adding or editing one of the yaml files in there. I will update this README with a format for this in the future.
