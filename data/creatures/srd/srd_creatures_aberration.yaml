If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target''s head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement.

          desc: |-
            The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.
            Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.
            A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.
    traits:
        - name: Damage Transfer
          desc: While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down). and that creature takes the other half.
        - name: False Appearance
          desc: While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.
        - name: Light Sensitivity
          desc: While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

          desc: The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn't incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction.
